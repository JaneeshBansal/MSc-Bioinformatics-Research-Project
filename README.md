MSc Bioinformatics Research project code

## General

This pipeline was generated as part of a Bioinformatics Research project with the BrancoLab to identify the location of polyTE's.
This repository contains the files required to run the pipeline but also the scripts used for performance analysis and the code to produce plots as a part of the report. 


## Project notes 

Throughout the projects notes were taken each day to record the progress. There are also condensed notes for the specific parts of the project.
