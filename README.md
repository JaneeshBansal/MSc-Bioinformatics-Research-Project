# MSc Bioinformatics Research Project - PolTED

## General

PolTED was generated as part of a Bioinformatics Research project with the BrancoLab to identify the location of polyTE's.
This repository contains the files required to run the pipeline but also the scripts used for performance analysis and the code to produce plots as a part of the report.
